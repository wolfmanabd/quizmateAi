                <p className='mt-4  '>The correct answer is B. Jane Austen because she is the author of the novel "Pride and Prejudice." Jane Austen was an English novelist who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries and is renowned for her novels exploring themes of love, social class, and marriage in British society. "Pride and Prejudice" is one of her most famous works, portraying the lives and relationships of the English gentry during the Regency era. Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, and Emily BrontÃ« are all acclaimed authors in their own right, but they did not write "Pride and Prejudice."</p>
